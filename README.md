# Burj Khalifa - Dice Roll Game #

We are visiting the tallest building in the world, the Burj Khalifa (829.8 meters / 162 floors) and decide to play a game.

- Roll 2 dice and combine the score
    - If the roll is divisible by 3, you go up 3 steps
    - If the roll is even, you go up 2 steps
    - Otherwise, you go down 2 steps (but you can't go below the ground floor)
    - The stairs are slippery! there is a 0.1% chance you will fall all the way to the ground floor.
- 100 rolls, where do you end up?

I bet you won't get above floor 90.  Do you take that bet?
